## What is Git?

    Git is free and open source software for version control, tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software developement.

## What is version control?

    Version constrol is a class of systems responsible for managing changes to computer programs, documents, large programs, and so on.

### Types of Version Control System:

    1. Local Version Control Sytems: 
    
        - It is a local database in a local computer, in which every file is saved as a patch. Every patch set contains only the changes made to the file since last version. 

        - The main problem with this is that if any damage happens to the local computer, the whole patch gets lost, further, any damage happens to a single version, the following versions are lost.

    2. Centralized Version Control System:

        - It has a single server that contains all the file verions. It enables multiple clients to pull the file, make changes, and push again to the server. It helps a team to work together on the same file at a server.

        - The main problem with this VCS is that everything is stored on a centralized server, if anything happens to this server, the whole data is lost and cannot be recovered if there is no backup. Hence, it can create chaos in the team.

    3. Distributed Version Control System:

        - With distributed version control systems, clients donâ€™t just check out the latest snapshot of the files from the server, they fully mirror the repository, including its full history. 
        
        - Thus, everyone collaborating on a project owns a local copy of the whole project, i.e. owns their own local database with their own complete history. 
        
        - With this model, if the server becomes unavailable or dies, any of the client repositories can send a copy of the project's version to any other client or back onto the server when it becomes available. It is enough that one client contains a correct copy which can then easily be further distributed.

## `GIT is a well-known example of Distributed Version Control System.`
